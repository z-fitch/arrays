#Demonstrate your understanding of index positions in this file. 
#You can write an explanation, provide some examples with the Arrays youâ€™ve created, or anything else.

#Index positions are the positions in the arrays. However they dont follow normal counting or listing rules( normal as in not in a coding enviroment) 
# they start at 0 and count up, for example if i had the array `numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]``, the "1" is in the 0th position, the "4" is in the 3rd postion.
