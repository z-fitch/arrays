#How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel pretty confident, I have worked with arrays in the past and this helped bring back the stuff i knew.

#Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I want to look over ruby docs more just in case there is any important ones that i should add to my notes.

#What questions do you have about Arrays
